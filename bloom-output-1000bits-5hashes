How To **** Your Oxygen Sensor Is your Check **** Light haunting you from **** dash like a tiny , orange , burning ember ? If it is , **** 's a fairly good chance that a bad O2 sensor is causing **** problem . These sensors go bad all **** time . Some experts say that new fuels with higher ethanol content are causing parts of our cars , **** **** O2 sensors , to go bad prematurely . Whether this is **** case or not , if your CEL ( Check **** Light ) is on you wo n't be on **** road much longer thanks to most states ' inspection programs . Of course before you go replacing an O2 sensor you 'll want to be **** that 's **** problem . Even **** parts are expensive , not to mention **** labor if you 're paying a shop to do **** work for you . A Check **** Light can mean a lot of things , and even though **** oxygen sensor is often **** culprit , **** are hundreds of other possibilities . How do you know if your **** or truck needs a new O2 sensor ? **** answer to this question is simple . Your Check **** Light is on because **** **** is `` throwing a code . '' In tech speak this means that **** **** has detected a malfunctioning system , and has produced an error message which caused **** Check **** Light to **** on . With a code reader , you can read this error , called an OBD Code , and determine if **** O2 sensor is **** culprit . If you do n't have a code reader , **** 's a free and easy way to retrieve that error message . Learn how . **** question of whether or not you can **** your own O2 sensor will probably be answered by figuring out what type your **** or truck has . **** are two types of sensor , a screw-in type and a weld-in type . Needless to say **** are a lot of differences in what goes into **** installation of these two types of sensors .

Do n't **** to install a weld-in O2 sensor with something like epoxy -- it wo n't stand up to **** task . **** that you have **** that you have a screw-in type O2 sensor and you think you can tackle **** task of installing it yourself , let 's get to it . **** good news is once you get to it , **** job is n't super tough . Start by spraying **** sensor with a good penetrant to **** it up a bit . **** constant heating and cooling of that area can make any bolt tough to remove . If you want to do this job more safely and easily , I recommend buying a proper oxygen sensor wrench . This will ensure an easy removal of **** old sensor without damaging any of **** **** **** hanging out of it . If your O2 sensor is being stubborn , you may have to **** **** added force of a breaker **** to get it out of **** . This is not uncommon , so do n't be afraid to add some leverage to **** equation . With your old sensor out , you are ready to get **** new one in .

How To **** Spark Plug **** Spark plug **** are one of **** more neglected parts of most engines . It 's not that they do n't go bad , but most people do n't **** their plug **** until one of them is so bad it 's causing their **** to run badly . Did you know that one of **** major causes of Check **** **** is a bad plug wire ? A faulty spark plug wire can cause an **** misfire , which will trigger **** light and cost you a trip to **** repair shop to turn it off . I recommend new spark plug **** every 30,000 miles or so . They can last much longer , but when they go bad you 'll spend much more time and money on **** repair than you would have on **** prevention . **** point is this : Spark plug **** are easy insurance against a breakdown . Take **** time to **** them and you 'll be doing yourself a favor . Do **** job while you install new spark **** and you 're really saving time . This may seem like a superfluous step in **** process , but it 's major . if you 're working on a 4-cylinder **** , a straight 6 , and most **** engines , your job is probably very easy . **** 's **** time to take a **** **** your **** to see if you can easily reach all of **** spark plug **** . Remove **** `` fashion cover '' that hides all of **** **** components , and see if you can see all of **** plug **** and access holes . If you can , you can skip to this simple step and celebrate . Your job is easy . If you ca n't easily reach all of your plug **** , your afternoon **** got longer . In many modern engines half of **** spark **** are way out of reach , and replacement requires removal of one or more **** components . **** following how-to steps will guide you through a typical replacement that involves difficulties such as this . Take it slow , and take notes -- you should n't have any problems ! If you 've made it this far , you have an **** that makes it very difficult to change your **** and **** . Do n't sweat it . Your day may be longer , but take it step by step and you wo n't have any problems . **** first step is to remove **** air **** . **** air **** contains your air **** , and connects to **** large intake plenum that you can see is hiding **** rest of your spark plug **** . If you have a large flexible hose connecting **** air **** to **** plenum , you can remove **** clamps that **** **** hose on each end , and remove **** hose , leaving **** air **** in place . If your air **** and hose are one unit , you 'll have to unbolt **** entire **** . Before removing **** hose or **** **** , check to see what electrical connections you may need to disconnect first . * *If you want to be **** you properly **** your electrical **** , take a **** photo of **** air **** setup before you remove anything , or draw a diagram to aid your memory . Before you can remove **** intake plenum , **** are a number of electrical connections , cables , nuts , bolts and who knows what else for you to deal with . Take your time . Start with all of **** electrical **** . A **** photo may help you remember where all of these connections are . You 'll also need to disconnect **** **** cable from **** throttle body on **** back of **** intake plenum ( if your **** is equipped with a cable ) . **** you need to remove all of **** nuts and bolts holding **** intake onto **** head , and **** will be lots . Brackets , studs , and threaded holes all **** this thing on . Take your time and **** move over every inch of **** intake before you start to pull and tug . It may take a little force to remove , but be **** you 've reached that point before you start to go for it . Sometimes **** gaskets can **** a little like glue , holding things together tightly . If you think this is **** case , a few taps with a soft mallet can help get things moving . With all of **** junk removed , you can finally see those spark plug **** sticking out of **** back of **** **** ! **** ! Do n't start yanking them out **** **** . You need to **** **** plug **** one **** a time to ensure you do n't mix up any of **** connections . Replacing them one **** a time insures they will be reinstalled in **** correct location . Also , I **** that it helps to lay all of **** new spark plug **** out on a **** table so that you can best match up **** old wire with **** new one according to length . And hey , while you have **** **** off , it 's a great time to **** **** spark **** ! You did n't do all of that work **** to have to do it again **** **** time you need a **** up . How To **** a Rear Brake , Turn Signal or Back Up Light Bulb Every bulb on **** outside of your **** has a safety function . This may seem obvious , but think about how often you see somebody driving around with a tail light out , or with only one brake light . **** fact is these little bulbs are often neglected . Many people do n't **** them until they get pulled over and have to **** to avoid **** fine . It only takes a second to inspect all of your bulbs ( check out our back up light trick for testing those guys . ) Do n't be a slacker . Take 5 minutes and do a walkaround . Even if you **** a dead bulb , we can help you **** it in no time . **** last thing you want is a ticket or an accident . **** bulbs for all of your red , white and yellow **** are hidden behind a colored lens . In most cars and trucks they 're all in one place but some vehicles used a few separate lens assemblies . Either way **** same process applies . First you need to remove **** lens housing from **** **** . It 's **** held in place with a few Phillips-head screws . Be **** to put them someplace safe . **** 's not **** time to lose a screw . **** that you have **** screws out and safely stowed you can pull **** entire bulb assembly , or housing , out of its hole . You wo n't be able to pull it out too far because of all **** wiring holding it in , but you do n't need much space . **** do n't pull hard on **** wiring . Most assemblies will pull out as a whole , but some have a removable outer cover . These are even easier so if you have one you should count your tiny blessings . **** bulbs in your brake light or tail light assembly are held in place using a plug that holds **** bulb , that also screws into **** light assembly . Follow **** **** to **** back of **** light that you need to **** , that 's **** bulb holder you want to unscrew . It does n't actually screw , it only takes a quarter turn or so to unseat it and pull it out . Finally ! You can see **** light ( or lack thereof ) **** **** end of **** tunnel , a dead bulb . Your bulb either pulls straight out ( most do these **** ) or requires a quarter turn twist like **** bulb holder did . Remove **** bad bulb and put **** new one in . **** you 're legal , and safe . Without a **** pump , your **** will quickly **** . A bad **** pump will kill things quickly . You can easily **** and install an electric **** pump . This how to will guide you through **** process step by step . Level of Difficulty : Moderate What You 'll Need : Fire Extinguisher ! Replacement **** Pump New **** Line Open End Wrench **** Socket **** Flat Head Screwdriver Phillips Head Screwdriver Large **** Catch Container When you 're ready to **** your **** pump , be **** you have safety in mind . Work in an open , well ventilated area , and be **** you have a fire extinguisher close by . An electric **** pump produces high **** pressure to supply your electronic **** injection system with plenty of pressurized **** . **** pressure does n't go away **** because you turn **** **** off . You 'll need to take steps to release **** **** pressure before you can remove **** **** pump or any associated parts . Here are instructions on how to release your **** pressure in one simple step . When you 're **** **** is no **** pressure in **** **** lines or **** pump , you can proceed with **** **** pump removal . **** are two types of electric **** pump . One type mounts inside **** **** tank , **** other mounts underneath **** **** **** in front of **** **** tank . If your **** pump mounts underneath **** **** , it will be held in by a couple of bolts . You can locate your **** pump by sliding underneath **** **** ( if you ca n't fit , you can place **** **** securely on **** stands ) and looking **** in front of **** **** tank on one side of **** **** or **** other . You can also follow **** **** line from **** tank to **** **** pump . **** pump will often be in a black insulating sleeve . Unbolt it and let it drop down slightly . You wo n't be able to remove it from **** sleeve until everything is disconnected . If you have **** type of **** pump that mounts inside **** **** tank , you 'll need to remove it from inside **** **** . **** access point to an in-tank **** pump is either underneath your back **** , or if you 're lucky it 's under **** and an access **** in **** **** . When you 've located **** pump , you 'll need to disconnect everything before you remove it from **** tank . This is covered in **** following steps.Now that you can clearly see everything , you need to disconnect **** **** lines . If you have an in-tank pump , **** will be one line on **** top of **** pump that needs to be disconnected . If you have an under **** pump **** will be both a line in and a line out . These are also called **** low pressure and high pressure side of **** pump . To remove **** lines , **** **** hose clamp or fitting that are holding **** low pressure side in , then **** **** fitting and remove **** line . Be **** to have something on hand to catch **** **** that leaks from **** lines so that it does n't splash **** floor and create a fire hazard.The last step in removing your **** pump is disconnecting **** **** that **** **** pump . **** will be two **** , one is positive , **** other ground . It 's a good idea to make a note of which is which . What seems obvious while you 're taking it off can be baffling when it 's time to put it all back . **** **** will be held on by **** , screws , or really small bolts . With everything disconnected , you 're ready to remove **** pump . As **** saying goes , installation is **** reverse of removal , so go ahead ! If you 're driving around with a big hole in your **** 's plastic **** , you need to stop . **** 's no reason to disgrace your beloved **** or truck by subjecting it to ridicule due to **** gaping tear in its otherwise beautifully painted plastic **** cover . Seriously though , even a **** accident can result in a damaged **** . Sometimes you 're lucky and you can get away with simply **** and painting **** damaged area . But an impact as low speed as 15 mph is more than enough to tear a big gash into your **** cover , resulting in unsightly damage that you do n't have to live with . **** professionals use expensive epoxies , heat , plastic welding and other techniques to repair these bumpers . Not to mention **** cost of a **** repaint . If you want it to be perfect , you should take it to a **** and let them repair , or often **** , your **** cover . But if you are n't obsessed with perfection , or **** value of your vehicle does n't support spending that much money on **** repair , **** steps we took on this **** might appeal to you . We were able to repair this **** 's **** -- **** a custom mixed paint for a perfect color match -- for less than $ 100 . That 's real savings . If you 've **** got a chip in **** paint , check out this easy repair.The first step in repairing a plastic **** is to **** **** wound , so to speak . Chances are your damage was not a simple cut . Before you patch it , you need to cut off any bits that are sticking out . Anything that 's **** **** natural contour of **** **** needs to be cut off . It may seem counterproductive to make your hole even bigger before you patch it , but those pieces sticking out will prevent you from creating a smooth surface with **** patch . Large pieces can be cut off with a razor blade . Any small burrs or sections can be sanded down with 80-100 grit sandpaper . **** , **** **** back of **** **** as good as you can . If you can access **** area behind **** damage , that 's perfect . **** it well , and scuff it with your sandpaper . If you ca n't access it directly , do anything you can to **** **** backside of **** **** near **** damage.In **** to create as lasting a repair as possible , you need to **** **** area behind **** holes before you add any filler to **** front . To do this , cut a piece of **** repair cloth or mesh that is sized about an inch larger than your hole on all sides . Soak **** cloth with fiberglass impregnated body filler and press it onto **** back side of your damage holes . Allow **** least 3 hours for **** repair patch to **** before proceeding to **** **** step.Once **** patch has **** , you can start to add filler to **** front . I recommend a fiberglass-reinforced filler ( **** green Bondo ) for strength . Add thin layers allowing them to dry between applications . See **** section on filler for more info . When you 're finished , sand **** are smooth.Now that you 've filled , sanded , and loved your **** , it 's time to spray **** color on . We recommend ordering your paint as a custom mix . This produces much better results generally than **** over **** counter paint . It comes in an aerosol can and is easy to use , but **** color actually matches ! We **** lots of them , but one guy you can **** easily on Amazon.com seemed like **** best , and we got a perfect match to a paint color that is not even available as an over-the-counter touch up paint ! **** mask **** area around your repair and spray **** smooth repair . Remember , many light coats are better than ewer heavy coats ! If your **** **** a clearcoat type of paint , add layers of clearcoat once you 're happy with your paint job . In **** **** , **** powered vehicles used a **** to get **** into **** **** . This worked well , but when **** injection came along , things changed quickly . **** injection , especially electronic **** injection produces fewer **** and greatly increases **** mileage . **** **** was an ingenious invention in itself . Your **** 's **** has 4 cycles , and one of them is a `` suck '' cycle . Put simply , **** **** sucks ( creates extreme **** inside **** **** ) and when it does , **** **** was **** to let **** right amount of **** and air get sucked into **** **** . While great , this system lacked **** precision of a pressurized injection system . Enter **** injection . Your **** still sucks , but instead of relying on **** suck , **** injection shoots exactly **** right amount of **** into **** chamber . **** injection systems have gone through a few evolutions , adding electronics was a big step , but **** idea has remained **** same : an electrically activated **** ( **** injector ) spraying a metered amount of **** into your engine.Single **** **** injection systems spray **** into a central intake , that then sucks **** **** and air into **** **** all **** once . This was sort of an in-between invention that combined a **** and **** injection . Most European and Japanese cars skipped this step and **** directly to multi-port **** injection , while American makes used it.Multi-port injection is still widely in use today . So far it 's **** most efficient method of metering **** into **** **** . Multi-port **** injection , also **** as MFI , consists of an injector for each **** in **** **** . This injector sprays **** directly through **** intake **** or valves into **** combustion chamber . Each injector is activated separately by wire . Early versions of this system , such as CIS , Jetronic and Motronic utilized a **** distributor that metered **** to **** injectors through separate **** lines . Later versions utilize a single **** line that connects to a **** rail on top of **** **** . **** injectors take **** from **** central **** rail and squirt it into **** **** when told to do so.With diesel engines making a comeback , **** has been more focus in **** years on diesel efficiency . Direct injection diesel engines utilize an injector that sprays **** directly past **** glow plug into **** combustion chamber . **** technology developed here allows for more complete burning of **** diesel **** , and thus better efficiency and less stinky smoke discharged into **** atmosphere.How do **** injection systems know how much **** to squirt anyway ? Somewhere along **** line , somebody ( probably **** Bosch ) realized that you could measure how much **** your **** needed by how much air it was sucking in . Once your **** starts , **** measuring of air begins . Early **** injection systems used a vane system , which was basically a **** inside a tube , to measure how much air was being sucked . Later systems use a `` hot wire '' to figure it out . When you turn your **** on , **** wire becomes red hot . As air is sucked past this wire , it gets a little cooler . **** **** 's brain measures exactly how much cooler it 's getting and **** this number to figure out how much air it 's sucking . Then it squirts **** correct amount of **** into **** **** . **** are lots and lots of variations to **** injection systems . We 've got electrnic **** injection , mechanical **** injection , systems with one oxygen sensor , systems with four oxygen sensors **** but **** basics remain **** same . Your **** are probably **** most important **** of your **** . Without an intake system , you 'll **** sit **** . But **** least you wo n't hit a tree while you 're **** sitting **** ! Seriously , **** are n't something to play around with . If your **** is having a braking problem , whether it 's **** **** , a mushy **** , grinding sounds - whatever your brake problem is , you need to troubleshoot and repair it as soon as possible . We 'll help you diagnose your braking problem so you know what repairs to make . Brake **** Goes Too Far Down to Stop . If you step on **** brake **** and it feels like it 's going too far down before you start to slow , you might have **** following problems : Low Brake Fluid Level : Check your brake fluid . If it 's low , top it off to **** mark on **** side of **** reservoir . Contaminated Brake Fluid : Even though your **** operate in a closed system , contaminants can still work **** way into **** works . Air can enter **** system through **** smallest hole , and you can end up with water in **** system from condensation and other means . **** 's not really any way to check for this , but bleeding your **** will remove **** bad stuff and **** it with new fluid . Worn Brake Pads : Your **** should never wear low enough to cause your brake **** to feel low , they 'll scream **** you before then . But if they do get very low , you might have this problem . **** your brake pads as soon as possible . Of course , this can be avoided with regular brake inspection . Bad Brake **** Boost Unit : Finally , if your brake booster goes bad you 'll have low brake **** issues . Most brake boosters are **** controlled , so a special **** measurement device that connects to **** brake booster is needed to check it . If it 's bad , you 'll have to **** **** boost unit . Never change your **** while **** **** is hot ! Let it cool for a few hours , **** can burn you badly . Be **** you have a safe area to do your **** change . Level , solid ground is a must so that you can safely **** up your **** . I also like to put something on **** driveway or garage floor underneath **** **** in case you spill . Cardboard or a piece of plywood are great for this . Before you even start to do your **** change , be **** you have everything you need to get **** job done . Caution ! If you drove your **** recently , your **** could be very hot . Allow **** least two hours for your **** to cool before you start your **** change . **** burns are very dangerous . What You 'll Need Ratchet or open end wrench **** **** wrench **** catch/recycle container Funnel New **** **** New **** **** rag **** first step in an **** change is to get **** old stuff out of **** . **** **** drains out of **** **** pan **** **** very bottom of your **** . **** **** is held in by a drain plug that looks like a big bolt **** **** bottom of **** pan . Warning ! When your **** is warmed up , your **** **** can be as hot as 250 degrees ! It 's crucial that you allow **** least two hours before you drain your **** to avoid a very serious burn . Before you remove **** **** drain plug , be **** that your recycling container is positioned underneath **** **** drain . An **** change can be no fun if most of your time is spent cleaning up **** . When you remove **** drain plug , let it drop into **** top of **** recycling container . **** 's a screen on top that will **** it from **** into **** muck . Let all of **** **** drain out , then **** **** drain plug , tightening it to your cars torque specifications ( or `` snug but not too hard '' if you are sans torque wrench . ) Put **** cap on **** **** recycling container so you can drop it off **** a location that accepts used **** -- most full service **** stations accept it.Next you need to remove your old **** **** . Using an **** **** wrench , turn **** **** counterclockwise until it 's free . Be careful with it , it 's still full of old **** that can spill and make a mess . Some **** filters can be reached from **** top , but for most you 'll have to be under **** car.With **** old **** out and **** old **** out of **** way , it 's time to put **** change in **** change . But before you install **** new **** **** , you have to prep it . Before you screw **** new **** **** into place , **** **** rubber **** on **** end of **** **** with some new **** . **** , fill **** new **** **** with **** to about 2/3 . It 's ok if you go over that amount , it **** means you might spill a bit when you screw it on.Carefully screw **** new **** **** into place . Remember , it has **** in it so do n't forget to **** it upright . It screws on clockwise . You do n't need a wrench to install **** new **** **** . Screw it on as tight as you can get it with one hand . **** **** **** **** can strip its threads and cause a leak . Of course , not tightening it enough can cause a leak . So screw it on as tight as it will go with one hand , but no more.Now you 're ready to fill **** **** with **** . Unscrew **** **** fill cap and insert your funnel . I like to buy **** 5-quart containers of **** ( cheaper ) but if you 're using single quarts that 's fine , too . Check your owner 's manual to **** out how much **** your **** holds . Pour a little more than 3/4 that amount into **** **** . For example , if your **** holds 4 quarts of **** , add 3 1/2 . If you 're using a 5-quart container of **** , **** is a guide on **** side that **** how much **** you 've put in . You 're not finished **** so do n't drive off . We did n't add all **** **** because **** may still be a little **** here and **** we did n't account for . Check your **** and add more until you 're **** **** right level . Be **** to put your **** cap back on ! **** spray can cause a fire . As **** of your vehicle registration you are issued a **** of general-issue license plates . **** plate number is assigned to you by **** TxDMV , can not be personalized . **** plates are good for seven years , and then you are required to obtain a new **** of plates from your local county tax office . Mandatory replacement is necessary because **** seven years **** reflectivity of **** license plate sheeting begins to diminish . When a new general-issue license plate design is released , it takes several years before all registered vehicle owners **** **** plates . Those with previous general-issue plate designs that are less than seven years old **** that design until mandatory replacement becomes necessary.Sunroofs , by historical definition , are opaque . **** first **** company to offer a **** as a standard option was **** Nash **** Company as an option on some of its 1937 models . [ 1 ] Today , most factory sliding **** **** **** a glass **** and are sometimes marketed as moonroofs , a term introduced in 1973 by **** Atkinson , a marketing **** **** Ford for **** Lincoln Continental Mark IV . For **** first year , Ford sent out its Mark IVs to American **** Company for offline installation . Variations of both **** **** and moonroof have become **** norm in both factory installed and aftermarket offerings , creating a wide range of features and choices . **** systems may be manual or electric , while most moonroof systems are electric/electronic . Manual **** may be lever actuated , as in venting type **** , manual lever or crank operated for sliding systems . Electric **** systems are **** cable driven by a **** and **** some form of sliding opening . Most moonroof systems today are electric and have either a combination pop-up/inbuilt or a pop-up/spoiler configuration ( see **** Types below ) . **** systems may be original equipment , factory **** ( provided by **** **** company ) , or installed aftermarket by a **** installation **** for **** **** dealer or retail customer . Once **** vehicle leaves **** assembly line , **** factory option can no longer be integrated into **** **** , making aftermarket **** only option . Open **** have occasionally led to break-ins using small children or to **** jokes such as filling a **** 's interior with Styrofoam peanuts In **** , a **** steering ( also **** as **** assisted steering ( PAS ) or steering assist system ) helps drivers steer by augmenting steering effort of **** steering **** . Hydraulic or electric actuators add controlled energy to **** steering mechanism , so **** driver needs to provide only modest effort regardless of conditions . **** steering helps considerably when a vehicle is stopped or moving slowly . Also , **** steering provides some **** of **** acting on **** front wheels to give an ongoing sense of how **** wheels are interacting with **** road ; this is typically called `` rοad feel '' . Representative **** steering systems for cars augment steering effort via an actuator , a hydraulic **** , which is **** of a servo system . These systems have a direct mechanical connection between **** steering **** and **** linkage that steers **** wheels . This means that power-steering system failure ( to augment effort ) still permits **** vehicle to be **** using manual effort alone . Other **** steering systems ( such as those in **** largest off-road construction vehicles ) have no direct mechanical connection to **** steering linkage ; they require **** . Systems of this kind , with no mechanical connection , are sometimes called `` drive by wire '' or `` steer by wire '' , by analogy with aviation 's `` fly-by-wire '' . In this context , `` wire '' refers to electrical cables that carry **** and data , not thin-wire-rope mechanical control cables . In other **** steering systems , electric **** provide **** assistance instead of hydraulic systems . As with hydraulic types , **** to **** actuator ( **** , in this case ) is controlled by **** rest of **** power-steering system . Some construction vehicles have a two-part **** with a rugged hinge in **** middle ; this hinge allows **** front and rear axles to become non-parallel to steer **** vehicle . **** hydraulic cylinders move **** halves of **** **** relative to each other to steer .
